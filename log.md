## Week 5
Jared, Maverick, Alex: Removed some code that wasn't needed and touched up the process function a little bit. Attempted to alter the tokenizer to adjust for the parsing an entire algorithm, but errors occurred. 

Current Issues: We are having issues with indexing errors after tokenizing each symbol. We believe that we're going to have to restructure the entire tokenizer due to the use of some variables having attributes (nulld) that are unknown to us.

Reflection: This week we weren't able to get much done due to some of us having to deal with midterms from other classes and other responsibilities, but next week we should be able to get the ball rolling a bit and hopefully get a substantial output.
